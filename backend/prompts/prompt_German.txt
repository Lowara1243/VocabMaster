{context_prompt}For the word/phrase "{word}", which is in {source_lang}, provide ONLY a JSON object:
- "infinitive": The base or dictionary form of the word in {source_lang} (e.g., for a verb, its infinitive form). If the word is a noun, include its definite article (der, die, das) AND its plural form in brackets. For example: "der Apfel (die Äpfel)", "das Auto (die Autos)".
- "transcription": IPA in format [example]. If word doesn't exist, is misspelled, or unknown, use "N/A". Use the "infinitive".
- "translations": list of {target_lang} translations for the "infinitive" form (all common meanings, can be 1 or more)
- "examples": list of at least 2 examples with "source" and "translation" keys. In the "source" text, you can use other forms of the word/phrase. Highlight the used form with # symbols.

Important rules:
- The provided word/phrase is in {source_lang}. You MUST treat it as a {source_lang} word/phrase.
- If word/phrase doesn't exist or you're uncertain: set transcription to "N/A"
- For multi-word phrases, highlight the entire phrase: #phrase#
- Provide up to 3 examples when possible
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown blocks, no additional text

Example: {{"infinitive": "der Apfel (die Äpfel)", "transcription": "[deːɐ̯ ˈapfəl]", "translations": ["яблоко"], "examples": [{{"source": "Ich esse einen #Apfel#.", "translation": "Я ем #яблоко#."}}, {{"source": "Die #Äpfel# sind rot.", "translation": "Эти #яблоки# красные."}}]}}
