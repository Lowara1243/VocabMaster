{context_prompt}For the word/phrase "{word}", which is in {source_lang}, provide ONLY a JSON object:
- "infinitive": The base or dictionary form of the word in {source_lang} (e.g., for a verb, its infinitive form). If it's a verb, add the particle "to" (e.g., "go" -> "to go").
- "transcription": IPA in format [example]. If word doesn't exist, is misspelled, or unknown, use "N/A". Use simplified IPA: DO NOT use syllable breaks (.) or tie bars (͡). Use the "infinitive".
- "translations": list of {target_lang} translations for the "infinitive" form (all common meanings, can be 1 or more)
- "examples": list of at least 2 examples with "source" and "translation" keys. In the "source" text, you can use other forms of the word/phrase. Highlight the used form with # symbols.

Important rules:
- The provided word/phrase is in {source_lang}. You MUST treat it as a {source_lang} word/phrase.
- If word/phrase doesn't exist or you're uncertain: set transcription to "N/A"
- For multi-word phrases like "give up", highlight the entire phrase: #give up#
- Provide up to 3 examples when possible
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown blocks, no additional text

Example: {{"infinitive": "to run", "transcription": "[tə rʌn]", "translations": ["бежать", "управлять"], "examples": [{{"source": "I love to #run# in the morning.", "translation": "Я люблю #бегать# по утрам."}}, {{"source": "He #runs# a small business.", "translation": "Он #управляет# малым бизнесом."}}]}}
